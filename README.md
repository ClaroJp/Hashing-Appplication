# Phone Directory Application

## Introduction
The Phone Directory is a simple Java console application designed to store and manage a collection of contacts. It utilizes a **HashMap** data structure to efficiently store and retrieve contact information (names and phone numbers). The application allows users to interact with their contacts, adding new ones, searching for existing contacts, and displaying all stored contacts.

## What it Can Do
This application provides the following functionalities:
- **Add Contact:** Users can add new contacts by providing a name and phone number.
- **Search Contact:** Users can search for a contact by entering the name, and the application will quickly retrieve the corresponding phone number.
- **Display All Contacts:** Users can view a list of all contacts stored in the directory.
- **Exit:** Exits the application.

## Why I made this application
I created this application as a student to enhance my programming skills by solving practical problems like managing a phone directory efficiently. It allowed me to apply concepts of Java and data structures in a real-world scenario, helping me understand how to design and implement user-friendly applications. This project not only improved my coding abilities but also provided a tool that simplifies organizing contacts, which can be useful to students and the community for everyday tasks like managing group projects or keeping track of important contacts.
